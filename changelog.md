v2.10.1-SNAPSHOT
---
###### Apr 11, 2018
* Fixed unitName method issues that couldn't identify the material's name.
* Fixed some by mistake schematics.

v2.10-SNAPSHOT
----
###### Jun 22, 2017
* Supports the latest version of WorldGuard and Factions.

v2.9
----
* DEPENDS ON JAVA 8. If your server is not on Java 8 yet, you should upgrade, or ask your service provider to upgrade. Java 7 isn't supported anymore by Oracle.
* Should now work both in regular as well as async context. This means there should be no more "Asynchronous entity world add" errors anymore, and Gringotts is now compatible with Towny in async mode, as well as other plugins that call economy methods asynchronously.
* The maximum virtual money allowed for an account is now equal to the *lowest* denomination, instead of the highest. I changed this because that behavior was causing lots of confusion.
* fixed other minor bugs

v2.8
----
* built for Minecraft 1.9 and Factions 2.8. May not be compatible with older Factions versions!
* unsupported versions of Factions should be handled more gracefully now.
* updated to current version of Metrics-Lite. Fixes annoying error messages.

v2.7
----
* Named denominations: Each denomination can now have its own name, which will be shown in /balance messages and the like. To activate this feature, use the `named-denominations` config setting. By default this will use the denomination's displayname or regular item name, but you can define a custom name as well. See [configuration instructions](https://github.com/MinecraftWars/Gringotts/blob/master/doc/configuration.md) for details.
* Balance messages can now be configured to show only regular balance or also vault/inventory balances. 
* Now also supports `&` prefix to color codes in messages and item displayname/lore in addition to the default `ยง` prefix.
* can now also used Vault-supported item names in denomination config, not only regular Bukkit names. This can make the config a bit more intuitive. (requires Vault)
* lore config for denomination items now also allows a simple string instead of a string list.
* configuration should now always be loaded as UTF8.
* fixed an issue with `/money` commands failing on some servers.

v2.6
----
* adds display name and lore support for currency items. See [configuration instructions](https://github.com/MinecraftWars/Gringotts/blob/master/doc/configuration.md) on how to configure this.
  Thanks to dj5566 for contributing this feature!
* `startingbalance` config option works again

v2.5
----
* fix some currency requests causing internet accesses and thus lag spikes. Should fix some problems people have been having with Towny
* /money now shows money in vaults and money in inventory in addition to total balance

v2.4
----
* updates to dependency versions:
    - Bukkit API 1.8.3-R0.1
    - Vault API 1.5
    - Factions / MassiveCore 2.7.5 (incompatible with older Factions versions)
    - Towny 0.89.2.0
    - WorldGuard 6.0 beta
* minor fixes in message formatting

v2.3
----
* supports player UUIDs
* old Derby databases will be automatically migrated to the Bukkit-internal database
* player names in the database will be automatically migrated to UUIDs
* built against Bukkit 1.7.9, Vault 1.4, Java 7. 
  This version of Gringotts will no longer work with older versions of Bukkit, Vault and Java.
* vaults can now be created from most containers (chest, trapped chest, hopper, dropper, dispenser, furnace)
* fix a bug preventing creation of vaults when the db still contained vaults in deleted worlds
* fix a bug allowing to create multiple vaults on a single container

v2.2
----
* use factions 2.x
* build against bukkit 1.7.2

v2.0 beta5
----------
* fix NPE with trying to get a chest from a null block
* fix NPE when you delete a world with chests in it

v2.0 beta4
----------
* fix vault creation breaking under some circumstances involving Towny
* added support for built-in Bukkit database support. This means that the Derby library is no longer required. If the Derby jar is present, Gringotts will continue to use it, otherwise a DB will be created via the Bukkit API. This should also support MySQL if you configure it in bukkit.yml. Please see the [Bukkit Wiki](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Bukkit.yml#database) for details.

v2.0 beta3
----------
* fix bug where Towny vaults would get deactivated on creation of other chests or deposits
* update Vault connector to Vault v 1.2.24 -- this version of Gringotts may be incompatible with older versions of Vault

v2.0 beta2
----------
* ops/players with permission `createvault.forothers` can now create vaults for other players and other accounts by creating the vault as usual, but adding the owner's name/id on the thord line of the sign.
* fix bug with WorldGuard vault creation permissions

v2.0 beta1
----------
* can create a vault now by attaching the [vault] sign to a chest directly (shift+rightclick with a sign), instead of requiring it to be above the chest
* added string customization / internationalization for messages to players (contributed by KanaYamamoto/Daenara)
* German translation (contributed by KanaYamamoto/Daenara)
* accounts can have a purely virtual starting balance (contributed by bezeek)
* support for WorldGuard region vaults. Region owners may create a `[region vault]` with the id of the region on the third line.
* /moneyadmin command now supports optional account type parameter. example: `/moneyadmin b foo faction`. This is primariliy intended for plugins that use worldguard for region management, as there are no player commands to handle these accounts.
* for devs: added an event system for vault creation. Gringotts triggers a `PlayerVaultCreationEvent` when a player attempts to create a vault in the world. Plugins can register an event handler and supply their information for Gringotts to create their own vault types.

* configuration option `currency.fractional` deprecated in favor or `currency.digits`, which specifies the amount of decimal digits to use, and consequently the smallest possible currency value.
